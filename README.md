# 🧠 Student Mental Health Analysis (PostgreSQL)

This project explores the relationship between cultural adjustment and mental health among international students using survey data from a Japanese university in 2018. Using PostgreSQL, I analyzed how factors like social connectedness, acculturative stress, and length of stay relate to depressive symptoms.

The original study found that international students are more likely to experience depression, and that social connectedness and acculturative stress are strong predictors. My goal was to test these findings using SQL to explore patterns within the dataset.

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

- Do international students have higher depression scores than domestic students?
- How does social connectedness relate to depression levels?
- Is acculturative stress positively correlated with depressive symptoms?
- Does the length of stay in the host country reduce depression risk?

## 🧠 Summary of Insights

- **International students** had significantly higher average depression scores compared to domestic students.
- Students who reported **stronger social connectedness** showed lower depression scores overall.
- Higher levels of **acculturative stress** were strongly linked to increased depressive symptoms.
- A **longer length of stay** in the host country was associated with slightly improved mental health, indicating gradual cultural adaptation may help reduce stress.
